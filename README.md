# JavaScript - JavaScript and DOM Manipulation

## Background

The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! All we need to do now is put this information online for the world to see and then the matter will finally be put to rest.

Create a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). Allow users to filter the table data for specific values only using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. 



### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Used the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to the web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Made sure to have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Used a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.



### Dataset

* [UFO Sightings Data](StarterCode/static/js/data.js)
